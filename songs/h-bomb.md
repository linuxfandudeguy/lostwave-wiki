### Leads and Theories

#### H-Bomb Boogie

There has been speculation about a connection between *H-Bomb* and a 1953 10" single titled *H-Bomb Boogie* by *Benn Cristy’s Rhythm Five*, released in Belgium. However, this theory is unlikely, as the music style and instrumentation differ significantly, and there is no evidence to link the two songs.

#### "Dick Dorn" Lead

A Reddit user, u/garoto_aleatorio14, speculated that the artist behind *H-Bomb* could be Dick Dorn, based on similarities in the music style and voice. However, there is no supporting evidence to substantiate this claim.

### Lyrics


Now here's a little story that I would like to tell
It's 'bout this big old world and how it's gonna swell
There's been many times that it tried to explode
Because of two big wars, it tried to unload
It's called H-bomb!

Now the worst ol' war that we'll ever see
Will start with one big bomb from over the sea
So please take heed to what I have to say
Keep this thing from happening in that awful way
It's called H-bomb!
