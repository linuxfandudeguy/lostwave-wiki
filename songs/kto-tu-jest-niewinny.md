## Search History

### 2021
On August 6th, 2021, Adam R made a post on r/namethatsong, mentioning a mysterious song recorded on a tape he bought. The seller claimed the tape was blank. Adam attached a Google Drive link to the compilation of songs recorded on said tape, which included:

The next day, Adam posted the song on YouTube.

### May 2023
On May 16th, 2023, a user named Sonilink2001 posted about the original r/namethatsong post on r/lostwave. This reignited interest in the song, and it started gaining traction among the Lostwave community.

### Late 2023 - Early 2024
On October 31st, 2023, a channel dedicated to the song was created on Polish Lostwave's Discord server. Users began speculating that the singer sounded similar to Beata Bartelik, though she was not behind the song. The consensus among community members was that the song was recorded on a tape, likely from the radio, as evidenced by its audio quality.

A user named Szpulak found the song's metadata on zaiks.org, revealing that it was written by Wojciech Jagielski and composed by Winicjusz Chróst. Later, rumors circulated that Joanna Starosta could be the singer, but this was not confirmed. Some members speculated that the singer could be Małgorzata Panecka, as her voice sounded similar to the one in the song.

A potential lead was found when the song appeared on a deleted Facebook page, but no new information emerged from this source. Beata Bartelik said that they were not the singer. Despite efforts to contact Polskie Radio, which supposedly had a full version of the song, the song was not played on the radio. The Polish Lostwave community was waiting for a license from Polish Radio.

### June-December 2024: GAD Records
On June 16th, 2024, Polish Lostwave's channel announced that the Polish music label **GAD Records** expressed interest in purchasing a license from Polskie Radio to release "Kto Tu Jest Niewinny" and other songs by Małgorzata Panecka.

On December 31st, 2024, the official GAD Records YouTube account uploaded a video titled “GAD Records 2025 (mix)” featuring a short, high-quality fragment of the song, indicating that a full release is planned for 2025.
