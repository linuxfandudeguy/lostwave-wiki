## Lyrics (interpreted)

### Verse 1
Falls to his knees, the air getting thin  
Falls like the leaves, defeat of the new king  
He feels (at the world?), as the light grows dim  
Stately as a book, victorious the new king  

### Pre-Chorus
(She feels?)  
The wheel forever turns  
The king now knows  
And the sun forever burns  

### Chorus
Praise for a change!  
Face for the change!  
Praise for [?] change!  
Praise!  

### Verse 2
Cold as the wind, with ice up his eyes  
As he sings to him, brother slowly dies  
He reaches out a hand, keeps him by his side  
Together rule the land, surely as the tide  

### Ending
(He feels)  
The wheel forever turns  
The king now knows  
And the sun forever burns
