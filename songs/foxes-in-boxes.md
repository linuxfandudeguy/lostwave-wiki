# Foxes In Boxes

"Foxes In Boxes" is an  R&B song that was originally featured on a GapBody CD from March 2004. It was the only song on the album not credited to any artist. The song is created by Lamya. The search for the song's identity was largely driven by its appearance in a GapBody CD listing from 2004 and had been an ongoing investigation since.

## Search History

On **April 7, 2021**, the song was first posted when it appeared on a GapBody CD listing from March 2004, posted by user **Michael Bise** on a blog dedicated to archiving Gap in-store playlists. The song was not credited with an artist, leaving it unidentified for some time.

On **May 17, 2023**, user **Ziro** reuploaded the song onto YouTube, which helped further the search for its origins.

On **May 27, 2023**, an ASCAP repertory listing for the song was found, which showed the song as being credited to **Lamya**. The song's style and vocal qualities were confirmed to match Lamya's sound. A cross-check revealed that the song was from 2004, and Lamya's MySpace account also listed the song, though it was about 30 seconds shorter on the platform. The ASCAP listing showed two versions of the song.

Unfortunately, **Lamya** passed away on January 8, 2009, with no direct way to confirm that the song was hers. The only potential way to fully confirm this is by contacting **Carrington Daren Micheal**, the songwriter credited with the song.

The song would be solved on **06/19/2024** by a unknown discord user, Lijones29 and Carrington Daren Micheal, the songwriter.

## Lyrics

By letting my desire, the climb to decline  
Is just one slow continuous motion  
Dangling in between make way to the extreme  
For the accidental, for the conventional miracle  

Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
Never apply to message to self  
Implied behind the implication  
Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
No thought to hear the message applied  
To find behind the implication  

**Chorus:**  
Foxes in boxes, fear is my sphere  
Hunting and hiding digressing each year  
Weeping and laughing, I'm gasping for air  
Stuck like an oyster, it's so unfair  

Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
Never apply to message to self  
Implied behind the implication  
Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
No thought to hear the message applied  
To find behind the implication  

Words in your hair, like voices underwater  
There's no escaping the destiny of repetition  
Between what you said and what you wanted  

Couldn't, shouldn't, didn't  
I really wanted to say you became  

Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
Never apply to message to self  
Implied behind the implication  
Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
No thought to hear the message applied  
To find behind the implication  

**Chorus:**  
Foxes in boxes, fear is my sphere  
Hunting and hiding digressing each year  
Weeping and laughing, I'm gasping for air  
Repressed like a jester with costume contraries  
It's so unfair  

Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
Never apply to message to self  
Implied behind the implication  
Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association  
No thought to hear the message applied  
To find behind the implication  

Someone who stands for something else  
Someone who stands for something else  
Someone who stands for something else  
By reason of association
